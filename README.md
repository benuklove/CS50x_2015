# CS50x_2015
All of my work from Harvard's CS50 except the project which is repo'd elsewhere.

This work was done from June 2015 to December 2015 in my spare time, with no regrets.
Great course.

Needless to say, if you want to get anything out of the course you should do it yourself.
And most of the problems have been changed/updated or replaced for this year.
